# Machine-vision

Through this project, I have Developed algorithms using openCV, Scipy frameworks and image processing techniques for feature extraction
Then, I applied machine learning models using Scikit learn to detect & predict cracks, tool wear, irregular surface finish & texture, improper tool/ workpiece mounting during machining.
The overall aim of this project is to aid intelligent machining and reduce production of defective products.
